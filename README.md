## Difficulties
This was one of the very first things that I've coded in JavaScript, and so naturally there was so much that I learned and it was a great challenge. I learned things like, using && because || wasn't working for me.
The let computerChoice when assigning a function to a variable needs to have the () or it will just return what the function looks like.
